# AI Personal Tutor

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered tutoring system designed to provide personalized learning plans and answer user questions, aiming to enhance educational experiences through AI-driven assistance. It exists to leverage AI capabilities in education, making learning more accessible and effective.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular design, with a FastAPI backend handling API requests, a Streamlit frontend for user interaction, and an AI core integrating language models and retrieval engines for generating responses. The architecture is structured around these components, facilitating a scalable and maintainable system.

## Entry Points

The following files can be run directly:

- `run_ai_core_test.py`
- `backend/app.py`
- `frontend/app.py`

## Module Relationships

Modules depend on each other through imports and function calls, with the AI core being central to the project's functionality, and the backend and frontend interacting through API endpoints. The data flow is orchestrated by the entry points, which initialize the necessary components and start the application.
