# DocAgent

## Overview

This project is a code documentation tool that generates markdown documentation for Python projects, utilizing change detection to optimize regeneration and reduce redundant processing. It exists to streamline the documentation process and provide insights into code structure and quality.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular design with a pipeline architecture, where the main entry points orchestrate the scanning, parsing, analysis, and generation of documentation. The core modules interact with each other through a series of dependencies, with the parser modules feeding into the analyzer modules, and the analyzer modules feeding into the generator modules.

## Entry Points

The following files can be run directly:

- `main.py`
- `main_v2.py`


## Module Relationships

The modules depend on and interact with each other through a series of imports and function calls, with the core modules providing utilities and services to the other modules. The parser modules, such as python_parser, feed into the analyzer modules, such as analyzer, which in turn feed into the generator modules, such as generator. The change_detector module interacts with the scanner and generator modules to optimize regeneration.
