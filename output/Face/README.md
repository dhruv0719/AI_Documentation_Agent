# Face

## Overview

This project is a face recognition system that utilizes computer vision and machine learning to detect and identify faces in images and video streams, likely for security, surveillance, or identity verification purposes. It exists to provide an efficient and accurate face recognition solution.

## Architecture

The project's architecture is a modular design with multiple entry points, consisting of face detection, feature extraction, and similarity search components that interact to provide face recognition functionality. The system leverages libraries such as dlib, YOLO, and FAISS for efficient face detection and similarity search. The modules are organized into utility functions, face detection, and database management components.

## Entry Points

The following files can be run directly:

- `main.py`
- `live_cam.py`
- `live_yolo_cam.py`


## Module Relationships

The modules depend on and interact with each other through function calls and data passing, with utility functions providing supporting functionality for face detection and database management. The face detection modules rely on the utility functions for image loading and preprocessing, while the database management modules interact with the face detection modules to store and retrieve face embeddings. The entry points orchestrate the interactions between these modules.
