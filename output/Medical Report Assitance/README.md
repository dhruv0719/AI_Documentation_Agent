# Medical Report Assitance

## Overview

This project is a Medical Report Assistant that utilizes natural language processing and machine learning to analyze medical reports, provide patient-friendly explanations, and ensure compliance with safety rules and regulations. It exists to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical report analysis and explanation generation.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular design with a pipeline-based architecture, where modules interact with each other to process medical reports, extract relevant information, and generate explanations. The pipeline consists of ingestion, parsing, safety analysis, and explanation generation stages, with each stage handled by separate modules. The project also utilizes a microservices-based approach, with separate modules for authentication, API routes, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system components.

## Entry Points

The following files can be run directly:

- `backend/api/main.py`
- `scripts/init_database.py`


## Module Relationships

Modules in this project depend on and interact with each other through a combination of function calls, API requests, and database queries. For example, the ingestion module depends on the parser module to extract relevant information from medical reports, while the safety analysis module depends on the parser module to analyze the extracted information and generate safety alerts. The RAG system components also interact with each other to retrieve relevant medical knowledge and generate explanations.
