# Code Documentation AI Agent

## Overview

This project generates markdown documentation for Python codebases by analyzing and interpreting the code structure and content, providing developers with a tool to automatically create and maintain accurate documentation. The project exists to simplify the documentation process and improve code readability.

## Architecture

The project follows a pipeline architecture, where the scanner module identifies Python files, the parser module extracts structured information, the analyzer module generates insights using an LLM, and the generator module creates markdown documentation. This pipeline is orchestrated by the main module, which coordinates the workflow and handles project configuration.

## Entry Points

The following files can be run directly:

- `main.py`


## Module Relationships

The modules interact through a sequential pipeline, where the scanner feeds parsed files to the parser, which outputs structured data to the analyzer, and finally, the analyzer's results are used by the generator to create documentation. The models module provides data structures used throughout the pipeline, while the main module oversees the entire process.
