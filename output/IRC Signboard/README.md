# IRC Signboard

## Overview

This project generates IRC:67-2022 compliant road signs using a configured generator and handles errors, existing to provide a tool for creating standardized road signs. It serves as a solution for managing sign configuration data and generating sign graphics.

## Architecture

The project follows a modular design, with separate modules for handling GUI, API, sign generation, and utility functions, allowing for a clear separation of concerns and reusability of code. The architecture is centered around the generator_v2 module, which coordinates the rendering of road sign elements and applies sign configuration parameters. The project also utilizes a pipeline-like structure, where data flows from configuration modules to generation modules.

## Entry Points

The following files can be run directly:

- `main.py`
- `app.py`
- `gui_app.py`


## Module Relationships

Modules depend on and interact with each other through imports and function calls, with the generator_v2 module being a central hub that coordinates the rendering of road sign elements. The sign_config module provides data structures for representing sign configurations, which are used by the generator_v2 module to generate signs. Utility modules, such as text_measurer and svg_parser, provide functions that are used by multiple modules to perform specific tasks.
